# MDJournal

**MDJournal** is a simple, terminal-based Markdown journaling tool written in Rust.  
It prompts you with daily reflective questions, formats your answers into Markdown, and saves them as dated `.md` files. This project is extremely simple, I just wanted something to work on **to learn the absolute basics of Rust**.
